# Conway's Game of Life

A fork of my second attempt at an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, with code put in to a class and advanced from there

- Fork of original test-driven approach, initial tests removed as backwards-compatibility broken
- Added a single class
- Uses a set of tuples of the live cell coordinates instead of a grid
- Visual run code in separate file
- Uses argparse to take grid size and cell character as command line arguments
- Allows input of starting grid state, includes coordinates of glider and glider gun
- PEP8 compliant
